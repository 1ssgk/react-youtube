              "title": "The World's Quickest Cars: Lucid Air Sapphire v Bugatti Chiron v Tesla Plaid - Cammisa's Drag Race",
              "description": "Jason Cammisa got the exclusive first test, strapped on his equipment, and broke the record: the Lucid Air Sapphire is the world's quickest-accelerating production car.\n\nWith a staggering quarter-mile performance of 9.1 seconds at 156 mph, this 1200+ horsepower 3-motor Air beat out the reigning champion, the triple-motor, 1020-hp Tesla Model S Plaid, which runs the 1/4-mile in 9.3 seconds at 152 mph.\n\nThe cars are \"tied\" at 2.1 seconds 0-60, though some trivia: the Lucid Air Sapphire gets to 60 mph 0.03 seconds before the Tesla Model S Plaid.\n\nWe weren't satisfied with just that race, so we also brought along the fastest-accelerating gas-powered production car, the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport. This is the 1479-hp (1500-PS) Chiron with shortened gear ratios, grippy Michelin Cup 2R tires, a fixed rear wing, and weight-reduction measures. \n\nEven despite these hyper-aggressive Michelins' distaste for cold tarmac, the Chiron ripped off a 2.3-second, four-wheel-burnout launch from 0-to-60 mph, and then continued on to a 9.3-second, 156-mph quarter-mile performance. That is a tenth quicker to 60 mph than the \"regular\" Chiron has managed, and a tenth quicker through the quarter, too. That's an internal-combustion production-car 1/4-mile record for the Chiron Pur Sport — and we suspect that, in warmer conditions, this Pur Sport would be even quicker! \n\nThat's not the case with the 210-hp Ducati Panigale V4 SP2, one of the quickest superbikes in the world. It had no traction issues as MotoAmerica Supersport champion rider Josh Herrin cracked the throttle wide open, dumped the dry clutch, and ripped off a stupefying 9.3-second, 157-mph run through the quarter-mile.\n\nThis beat our last outing with the same Panigale, when it handily dusted a 2023 C8 Corvette Z06. This time, Ducati softened the suspension and dropped the fork; Josh sacrificed the clutch and kept the wheelie at bay. It's safe to say this is the limit for the SP2 — except that Ducati offers a factory Akrapovic exhaust and tune that boost horsepower. We'd love to come back and try that again!\n\nBut for the moment, it's clear: among production cars with four wheels, the Lucid Air Sapphire is now the acceleration king, with the Chiron Pur Sport in second place. In one video, Tesla went from first to third.\n\nMay the fight continue.\n\nThis episode of Ultimate Drag Race Replay is brought to you by WeatherTech: https://www.weathertech.com/?utm_source=hagerty&utm_medium=web_visit&utm_campaign=Ultimate_Drag_Race_Replay\n\n\n===\n\n0:00 Introducing Lucid Air Sapphire, Tesla Model S Plaid, Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport, and the Ducati Panigale V4 SP2\n0:56 German 155-mph Autobahn Gentleman's Agreement - within 1/4 mile\n1:29 Tesla Model S Plaid vs E39 M5\n2:04 Lucid Air Sapphire Prototype\n2:30 Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport\n3:13 Main Event: Drag Race Sapphire vs Plaid vs Chiron!\n3:55 Walkback: Sapphire Drag Race explanation\n4:18 Why is Sapphire so much quicker than Air Dream Edition?\n5:05 Tesla Plaid in Last Place\n5:49 Bugatti Chiron Launch Control is violent\n6:00 EV vs ICE traction control: The 1000-Hz advantage\n7:07 Josh Herrin in the Ducati Panigale V4 SP2\n7:35 Bonus Race: Ducati Panigale V4 SP2 vs Lucid Air Sapphire\n8:24 The Ducati's quarter-mile-long wheelie\n9:03 Overall Drag Race Results — Rimac & Bugatti join forces\n\n==\n\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for new videos every day! http://bit.ly/HagertyYouTube \n\nVisit our website for daily automotive news, cars stories, reviews, and opinion: https://www.hagerty.com/media \n\nStay up to date by signing up for our email newsletters here: https://www.hagerty.com/media/newsletter/ \n\nFollow us on social media:\nFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/Hagerty \nInstagram | https://instagram.com/Hagerty \nTwitter | https://twitter.com/Hagerty \n\nIf you love cars, you belong with us.

This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “Fortnite Chapter 4!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Built a Real Life Fortnite Battle Bus, But CHAPTER 4 MEMES (best season), But Surprising Tfue, But Fortnite Chapter 4, But Battle Royal, But Fortnite Chapter 4 Season 1 Launch Trailer, But MR BEAST in Fortnite, But Fortnite CHAPTER 4 is HERE, But Fortnite Gameplay, But MrBeast Battle Bus or any other video like MrBeast, Home Of Games, Fresh, MrBeast Gaming, SypherPK, Top5Gaming, Fortnite, LazarBeam, More SypherPK, Unspeakable, Ryan Trahan, Preston, Typical Gamer, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.

              "description": "Welcome to what could be our most exciting review EVER! \n\nMat’s got his hands on the McMurtry Spéirling, and he’s about to find out if it can back up its claim of being the quickest accelerating road car ever made! \n\nNow before he even gets behind the wheel, you need to know that the McMurtry comes with a reputation! It's claimed the record as being the fastest car to complete the Goodwood Festival of Speed Hillclimb - beating an F1 car to the title by two whole seconds!\n\nBut what makes this lightning-fast single-seater so special? Well, it comes with an incredible fan system that helps to generate 2,000kg of downforce! This means the McMurtry is not only super quick off the line, but it can take corners at speed with ease. \n\nIn terms of power output, it has two electric motors that produce 1,000hp. Now you may not think that’s too impressive, given EVs such as the Rimac Nevera come with almost 2,000hp. However, whereas the Nevera weighs over 2 tonnes, the McMurtry Spéirling weighs less than one tonne!! \n\nNow, of course, all that power and performance doesn’t come cheap, costing just under £2,000,000. But if the car can break records as it claims, then it’s got to be worth it, right? \n\nAll we know is, this is one review you don’t want to miss! Will Mat go faster than he’s ever been before? And more importantly, will he break some records?!
